Synthetic Data Generation: Created a structured dataset simulating system metrics (e.g., CPU temperature, memory usage) with random values, saved as synthetic_dataset.csv.
Data Exploration: Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and visualized each metric using line plots for trend analysis.
Anomaly Detection: Used Z-scores to identify outliers, flagging values beyond Â±3 as anomalies.
Visualization & Output: Plotted anomalies alongside normal data points and saved the flagged dataset for further analysis.
